# Geolocalization App
Get notified and find any friends nearby within a given range from the user

# Problem Statement
Suppose a friend comes to your location but is not aware of your actual location as you might be at a place which is not located precisely in terms of distance in the case of Google Maps or whatsapp location sharing. In this case, we need an application to get the more appropriate location for us. Hence, we use Geolocalisation to notify friends about other’s location. Moreover, the friends do not have to check their maps regularly as the app itself notifies its users of their arrival at the destination.

# Existing Methods
- WhatsApp uses Google Maps as the default map for location sharing
- Uber relies heavily on Google mapping technology. Uber also uses Google's public cloud

# Proposal (Our Design)
We may consider two sections of the interface of the Geolocator application, which are Users & the Location on the map. So users section has the features to login, signup & add a friend and for the section of location on map we have the ability to share one’s location and to add a friend so that he/she may be notified upon one’s arrival.
